### Maps nearby places search

Material design maps places search implemented using Polymer 1.0 and the Google Web Components (`<google-map>`, `<google-map-directions>`, `<google-map-search>`), `<geo-location>`.

Uses async HTML Imports and the [app-shell concept](http://ebidel.github.io/polymer-experiments/polymersummit/fouc/appshell.html) for awesome first paint.

### Build

If you modify any of the elements in elements.html, you'll need to re-vulcanize:

   ./build.sh
